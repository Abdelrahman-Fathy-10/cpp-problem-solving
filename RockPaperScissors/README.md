# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A simple C++ console game to practice basic programming concepts.

## Description
This is my first mini project in C++ where you can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.  
The project helped me practice:
- Functions
- Enums
- Loops and conditions
- Random number generation

## How to run
1. Open `main.cpp` in your preferred C++ IDE.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Follow the instructions in the console to play the game.

## Notes
- This is a beginner-level project.
